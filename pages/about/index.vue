    <h1>About I Make the Sites</h1>
    <h3>BIO</h3>
    <p>
      I am very passionate about each of my projects and my objective is to
      create compelling software products that users will love! I am eager to
      develop attractive, functional, and mobile-friendly websites, web apps and
      mobile apps using current and cutting edge technology and code for you and
      your organization. After finishing my International MBA at the University
      of Memphis in 2011, I moved to China to teach English and look for
      international trade opportunities. Shortly after that, I began teaching
      myself web development. I started with HTML and CSS, then moved on to PHP,
      MySQL, JavaScript, and JavaScript frameworks like React.
    </p>
    <p>
      These past few years as a mostly freelance developer specializing in
      frontend development have taught me much, and I am eager to use what I
      have learned to help you and your company by streamlining your online
      operations and improving your development through implementation of best
      practices and asset optimization.

    <h3>Worklete</h3>
    <h6>Senior React-Native Developer</h6>

    <p>
      I worked with the development and design teams at Worklete to build and
      refine their mobile application built with React-Native.
    </p>
    <h3>The Data Tape/ArcheTape</h3>
    <h6>Front End React Developer</h6>

    <p>
      As a full stack developer, I built the web application, marketing website
      and React Native app from scratch and published the first version of the
      project.
    </p>
    <h3>LOB</h3>
    <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
    <p>
      I helped LOB revise their site's design using a CMS called Webflow, which
      the Marketing and Development teams required in order to collaborate. I
      used Marketo to manage the forms, CSS and JavaScript to control the
      appearance and functionality.
