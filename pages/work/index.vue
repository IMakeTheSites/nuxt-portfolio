          I worked with the development and design teams at Worklete to build
          and refine their mobile application built with
          React-Native.</b-card-text

          I helped LOB revise their site's design using a CMS called Webflow,
          which the Marimg-left class="mb-3"keting and Development teams
          required in order to collaborate. I used Marketo to manage the forms,
          CSS and JavaScript to control the appearance and
          functionality.</b-card-text

          I built a React Native mobile app for Rolfson Oil which allows drivers
          to print and scan tickets and push them to the server. I integrated
          REST APIs with Axios and Redux-Thunk and used several React-Native
          plugins.</b-card-text

          As a full stack developer, I built the web application, marketing
          website and React Native app from scratch and published the first
          version of the project.</b-card-text
